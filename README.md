# React Calculator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I created this calculator for freeCodeCamp using jQuery, and then later re-implemented it with React, which is the repository you see here. To visit the jQuery version's repo, head to https://github.com/DanielJWagener/calculator

Update 23/09/2020: App is now a PWA!
